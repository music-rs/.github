# Music Recommendation System

I am reviving my thesis project used at university and I am really fascinated to do it, as it combines my great passion for developing applications as well as my love for music.

## Objective

The aim of this project is to recommend music, concerts and festivals based on the musical tastes of the users.

## Technologies

I use technologies like Scrapy to extract information about concerts from websites like Joinnus and Teleticket; then these events are shown in a web developed with Angular and Java, and finally the heart of the system is a Python recommendation algorithm launched in a Flask server that is in charge of recommending music events according to the user's musical tastes. Fascinating, isn't it ?

I'm currently adding more integrations, using the Spotify API, a graph-based database like Neo4j and CI/CD using GitHub Actions and Azure.
